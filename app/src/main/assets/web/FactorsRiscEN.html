<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">Risk factors are those that facilitate the onset of eating disorders. They can be individual, group and social factors. The combination of these different risk factors can lead to the development and maintenance of the disease.</span>
</p>
<p class="c12"><span class="c4 c9">Individual factors</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Genetic predisposition: </span><span class="c1 c4">The risk of an ACT is increased above the values &#8203;&#8203;of the general population if there is a family history of an ACT. This factor, combined with other environmental types, such as family and social environments, may increase the likelihood of suffering an ACT.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Psychological traits:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Certain personality traits such as a high self-sufficiency, obsessive perfectionism, need for control and cognitive rigidity are closely related to the appearance of a TCA.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Low self-esteem:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Having low self-esteem, that is, making a negative and unsatisfactory self assessment increases the likelihood of suffering from TCA.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Negative body image:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;People who do not have a real image of their own body and that, in addition, the emotions and feelings that they have towards them are negative, they are more vulnerable when suffering an ACT.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Adolescence:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Adolescence is the vital stage in which there is a greater risk of developing a TCA. TCA was diagnosed in people of all ages, but in most cases the disease debuted during adolescence. This is because during this stage, personality, self-esteem and the social role of the person are in full development and, therefore, is more vulnerable to a social environment in which the pressure for the image is excessively high.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Female sex:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;In every 10 cases of ACT, 9 are women and 1 is a man, so being a woman implies a greater risk of suffering an ACT.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">4.2 Family factorsfamily</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">environment:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;UnstructuredFamilies in which there is no stable and secure structure are at greater risk of developing a TCA in one of the members, especially in those who are more likely to be at risk, such as teenage girls.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Family overprotective environment:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Those families in which communication and family dynamics are excessively rigid, controlling and demanding can influence the development of an ACT, especially in those with the greatest individual vulnerability, such as teenage girls.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Stressful life experiences:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Traumatic changes in the family structure, such as the death of one of the members may increase the likelihood of TCA.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">4.3 Social Factors</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Prevailing beauty modelThe current model of beauty, which boasts an excessive thigh, has a very important weight in the development of TCAs. In the last years, the appearance of this new beauty canon has been accompanied by a very remarkable increase in the incidence of TCA cases.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Social pressure retains the image:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;In the last decades, the social value of the image also It has gained relevance, so that we not only have a beauty model that is harmful to health, but also the social pressure received regarding the importance of resembling this model is excessively high. These two combined factors have a clear influence on the onset of TCA. The role of the media in the diffusion of the current beauty model places them as agents responsible, to a great extent, for the proliferation of TCAs in our society.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Certain sports or professions:</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;Certain sporting activities, such as dance, for example, may favor the appearance of TCA due to the treatment they make of the image in the practice of this sport. Other risk sports are those that compete by weight categories. There is also a risk group for all those who practice professions related to the world of fashion, entertainment and / or television / movies, since the profession often exerts pressure on having a certain image.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1 c4">Criticism and ridicule related to the physicist: People, especially children and adolescents, who have received criticisms and ridicules related to their physical appearance and which, due to this, have felt insecure with their image, may have a greater tendency to develop TCA.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1">The current carving system: The current carving system is a non-unified system that results in a heterogeneous pattern that is confused by the population, to the extent that the person is not able to know what their size is. The report</span><span

        class="c1 c4">, the presence on the Internet of pages that apologize for anorexia and bulimia as &quot;forms of life&quot; rather than as mental illnesses. These are pages directed by a person suffering from TCA and in which different people affected by the disease get in touch with the goal of exchanging tricks to lose weight, strengthen the pathological behaviors that are typical of the illness (such as self- weighing below what is considered healthy), and deceiving relatives and friends, among other actions. Access to this type of pages is very easy and given that there is no specific legislation in this respect, we do not have the necessary tools to eliminate this factor, which has such a negative influence, especially among boys and girls. younger girls</span>
